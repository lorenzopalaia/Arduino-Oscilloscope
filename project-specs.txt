Arduino:
- All projects involvig Arduino should include some sort of serial
  communication with the host.
  The serial communication should be handled via interrupt.

  Meaning: a project of arduino includes a "server" (arduino part),
  and a client (PC part). These are two different programs.
  No cutecom needed for using arduino.

- Use of resources:
  Use at least one interrupt a timer and an I/O port

Oscilloscope [2]:
   Arduino: timed sampling of up to 8 channels on the ADC,
            and streaming on PC

            Possibility of configuring (from PC)
            - which channel(s) are being sampled
            - the sampling frequency

            Possibility of operating in two modes
            - continuous sampling: (each sample is sent
              to the PC as it becomes ready)
            - buffered mode: a set of samples are stored 
              locally and then sent in bulk

            Implementation of "trigger"
            (a condition that decides when to start sampling, in buffered mode)

            Serial communication should be asynchronous (use an interrupt
            on the UART)
   
   PC: host program controlling the oscilloscope.
       Output might be done on text files and displayed with gnuplot.
